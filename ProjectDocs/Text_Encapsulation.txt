Class "Item" (Yellow Square gameObject on the sceen) has two methods. First one describes a process of the rotation of the square. 
It needs to take two parameters as input: if there will be rotation or not ( type bool)  and speed of the rotation (type float). 
This method is public and can be called from outside(in our case by the button "Rotation Controller" click).
Second one is private and  can do only thing -  change the color of squre every single sec if squre is rotated. This method impossible to 
call from outside, so this way mechanics of the change of the color was exactly Encapsulated in private method. In this way another objects
know nothing about this method and cannot used it.
