We are create the interface "IShow" and create inside of it one and only method "Show" with signature
of the method is "string MyMethod(int)". One more class "ShowMaker" implemented that interface and has describe
of the method "Show" according to the signature. 
For demonstration of an Abstraction in OOP, we  will call this method by another 
class "ShowController". ShowController class take away to own enter  type of data "IShow", so if you give to it 
instanse of the "ShowMaker" class and run the Show method  - we will seeing the squre. It's exactly what should will be.
Please, press the button "ShowController"
