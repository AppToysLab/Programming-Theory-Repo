We create the interface "IShow" and create inside of it one and only method "Show" with the signature 
of the method "string MyMethod(int)". One class "ShowMaker" implemented that interface and has 
described method "Show" according to the signature. 
For demonstration of the Abstraction in OOP, we  will call this method by another 
class "ShowController". ShowController class takes as input an "IShow", type so if you give to it
an instanse of the "ShowMaker" class and run the Show method  - we will see the square. It's exactly
what should be.
Please, press the button "ShowController"
